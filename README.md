TraktSharp
=========

A C# wrapper around the v2 Trakt API. Not affiliated in any way with the devs over at Trakt - please do not contact them for support with this library.

This project is a work-in-progress, it is not yet even alpha quality software. Development is nearing feature completion, but the unit tests and example code have yet to be written and the codebase is mostly untested at this point so may be unstable or subject to significant change. It is not recommended for anything other than experimental use at this point.
