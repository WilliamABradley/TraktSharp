TraktSharp
=========

A C# wrapper around Trakt API (currently supporting version 2 of the API). This project is not affiliated in any way with the devs over at Trakt - please do not contact them for support with this library.

The project is feature-complete in terms of API coverage and all methods have been tested to some extent. However, the Trakt API version 2 is still very new and subject to change, and this wrapper has not yet been tested in real world situations. It may be somewhat unstable and breaking changes may be introduced over the coming months. At this point it should be considered an early beta of an eventual 1.0 release. Use at your own risk.

##Usage

The easiest way to learn how to use TraktSharp is to clone the source and fire up the `TraktSharp.Examples.Wpf` project. This project contains a fairly feature-complete demo of all the features of the solution.

More documentation to come at some point...
